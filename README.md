### Bio
This is a rewrite of kylan.space utilizing C#, using the Blazor framework. Hosted on Windows Server 2022 utilizing IIS Server. 

### Motivation
I was ~~abducted~~ chosen into a 2 week "trial by fire" at work on July 23rd, 2025. Might as well make the most of it, and attempt to learn as much as I possibly can within the 2 week timeframe. This is my first attempt by using my main website as a learning vessel.

### Goals
 - [ ] Incorporate a MySQL database and store some random API data.. maybe weather?
 - [X] Display information from MySQL database on to the website.
 - [X] Grab information using C#, incorporate lists & enums in some fashion.
 - [X] Publish(?) blazor app on Windows Server 2022 in a nice way using Git maybe..
 - [X] Have fun

### Credits
Thanks to work, for throwing me in to the deep end to motivate me to finally learn *something*.
